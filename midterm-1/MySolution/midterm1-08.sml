A sequence xs of integers captures '231'
if there are three integers a, b, and c
appearing as a subsequence [a,b,c] of xs
satisfying c < a < b. NOTE that a, b, and c
do not have to appear consecutively in xs.
//
For instance, [1,3,4,2] does capture '231'
For instance, [1,2,4,3] does not capture '231'
For instance, [1,2,3,4] does not capture '231'
