Given a list of integers xs and an integer,
please implement a function that checks if
there exists a sublist of xs whose sum equals
the given integer:

fun
sublist_sum_test(xs: int list, sum: int): bool

NOTE THAT INTEGERS CAN BE NEGATIVE. ALSO THE
ELEMENTS IN THE SUBLIST DO HAVE TO BE CONSECUTIVE.
                        ^^

You can use unrestricted recursion to solve this problem.
